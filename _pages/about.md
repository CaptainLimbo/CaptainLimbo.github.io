<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Duke University, in the Duke Intelligent Interactive Internet of Things (I^3T) Lab under the supervision of [Prof. Maria Gorlatova](https://maria.gorlatova.com/). We as a lab work boardly in edge computing, IoT, and especially in augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR).

My research interests are user context sensing in AR/VR and the use of machine learning in it. Particularly I'm interested in detecting attention patterns of users using gaze dataset collected by AR/VR headsets.
