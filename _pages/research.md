# Modeling Situational Awareness in AR-Guided CPR


- Designed and implemented an AR application for AR-guided cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), along with simulated bleeding and vomiting incidents to evaluate situational awareness of CPR providers using AR guidance.
- Identified that slower and shorter saccades and longer time fixated on virtual content were correlated with situational awareness based on whether the incidents were detected and handled properly.
- Designed a graph neural network that represents fixations as nodes and spatial-temporal relationships between fixations as edges, achieving 83% accuracy in predicting situational awareness based on 7 seconds of eye tracking data.
- Paper accepted to IEEE ISMAR 2025, a leading conference in the field of augmented and virtual reality.

### Analyzing and Predicting the Distraction Potential of Augmented Reality
- Lab: Intelligent Interactive Internet of Things (I^3T) Lab
- Institution: Duke University
- Duration: July 2023 â€” Oct. 2024

- Developed a Sudoku helper application for AR and VR to study user attention, incorporating step-by-step guidance and controlled visual distractions.
- Conducted a comparative analysis of attention patterns using eye tracking in AR and VR, revealing that VR simulations induced a higher perceptual load and reduced user focus, while AR increased cognitive load, as indicated by increased fixation duration and decreased fixation rate.
- Helped to build an AR version of the Trail Making Test (TMT) to assess the impact of different distraction types (top-down, bottom-up, and spatial), showing that top-down distractions (task-relevant) caused the most significant performance degradation, while bottom-up distractions (salient but task-irrelevant) had only early-stage effects. Eye tracking data indicated that top-down distractions led to an increased fixation rate while bottom-up distractions resulted in lower gaze entropy, suggesting effective suppression of irrelevant stimuli.
- Trained time-series Transformers on eye tracking data to predict the presence of distractors and assess user attentional control.
- Papers accepted to IEEE ISMAR 2024 and ACM VRST 2025.
